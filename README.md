# mouselab-mdp-tools
Tools for analysis and simulation of Mouselab MDP experiments.

## Getting Started

To install:

```
git clone https://github.com/RationalityEnhancementGroup/mouselab-mdp-tools.git
cd mouselab-mdp-tools
pip install -e .
```

You can also install this without directly cloning the git repository:

```
pip install git+https://github.com/RationalityEnhancementGroup/mouselab-mdp-tools.git@main#egg=mouselab
```


If you will not make changes to the package code, you do not need to use the `-e` flag for installation.

## Examples

Examples can be found in the `examples/` folder, both for getting started with the package and submitting scripts to the
cluster for an exact solution.
